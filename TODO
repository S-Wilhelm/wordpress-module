FIXME Define proper state status messages
FIXME Definitions currently default to 'www-data'
    While this works on a default Debian install, it is NOT platform independent.
    Either have the code determine the platform-specific default,
    or require that the user be specified by the SLS files.
FIXME Input validation is virtually nonexistent

TODO Restore the 'missing docstring' inspection
TODO Determine how to handle multi-site vs single-site
    Probably best handled by a parameter 'multisite' defaulting to 'False'.
    Separate internal methods for the command variants would cause excessive redundancy,
    but dynamic command-string building would hurt readability.  What is the best trade-off?

REFINE For themes and plugins, should the ``name`` parameter be the theme/plugin name or the site_path?
REFINE Check if the 'pchanges' key in the return dict is needed, or if the tutorial is outdated
REFINE Split the execution modules into platform-specific variants for long-term use
REFINE Is there a built-in way to handle command sanitization and quote escaping?
